1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tylerking406/ArchAssignment2.git
2. Navigate to the project using any asm IDE(mars or QTSpim).
3. To _Increase the brightness_ of an image use text editor to change filePathIn and filePathOut
4. Run it on your asmIDE
5. To change an image to _grayscale_ use text editor to change filePathIn and filePathOut.
6. Run it on your ams IDE
7. for each image you need to change the Filepaths


## Usage

you can use this code to manipulate a 64 64 image, you can either increase its brightness or

## Configuration

for each image to be manipulated, manually change the File filePathIn and filePathOut

1. filePathIn:	.asciiz "C:\Users\NDXARI004\Documents\CSC2\MIPS\Ass2\input.ppm"
   filePathOut:	.asciiz "C:\Users\NDXARI004\Documents\CSC2\MIPS\Ass2\out.ppm"
